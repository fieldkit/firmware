 * These pointers are weird and unfortunately necessary.
 *
 * GCC was making PLTs that weren't using R9 to access the
 * GOT. Supposedly there is a flag -fno-plt that forces those
 * accesses to go through the GOT, though that's not implemented.
 *
 * The workaround is to just use function pointers, which get looked
 * up via the GOT in the usual manner for data.
