/* Calculate the checksum over the given block of data, optionally
 * specifying a checksum to be carried.
 *
 * The polynominal representation used is one where the coefficients are
 * inverted. This is done so that the checksum of a fully erased block
 * (with erased checksum bytes) passes.
 *
 * If the carry argument is not needed, pass CRC32_INIT.
 *
 * The polynomial used is the IEEE 802.3 CRC32 polynomial, which has a
 * Hamming distance of 4 over 4096 bit messages. For more information,
 * see:
